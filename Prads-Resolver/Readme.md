```
Resolve IPs from Prads logs
```

This plugin will read IPs from the Prads logs, resolve them and send them off as an IDM event.  Essentially giving you real-time dns resolution of assets.

You might want to limit what types of prads events get used for a sanity check.

Change the log location for your interface...
